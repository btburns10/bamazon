# BAMAZON

## About
An Amazon-like, CLI storefront built with mySQL and Node.JS. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. Bamazon tracks product sales across your store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store under the Supervisor view.
